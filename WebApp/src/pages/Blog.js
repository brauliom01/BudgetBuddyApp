                  <p>Use money as a tool, not a goal.
                      Before you begin planning, think about what you want to accomplish with your money.
                      Do you want to travel, start your own business, or champion an important social cause?
                      If those are priorities in your life, be sure to factor them into the equation.
                  </p>
                  <p>You are your greatest asset.
                      At your age, your income potential,
                      the amount of money you will earn over the next 20 to 30 years,
                      is most likely your greatest asset. To protect this asset,
                      make sure you have good health, disability, and life insurance policies, 
                      all of which should be relatively inexpensive given your youth.

              <h1 className="d-flex justify-content-center">How to save money</h1>

                  <p>Automate transfers: By setting up automatic transfers from your 
                    checking account to your savings account each month, the money will accumulate over time 
                    without any additional work on your part. This technique can be especially useful when your savings accounts a
                    re dedicated to specific goals, such as establishing an emergency fund, going on a vacation, or building a down payment. 
                  </p>
                  <p>Count your coins and bills: Another option is saving your change manually 
                    by setting it aside each night. After you have a sizable amount, you can 
                    deposit it directly into your savings and watch your account grow from there. 
                  </p>
                  <p>Prep for grocery shopping: Plan your meals ahead of time and make a list 
                    of the items you need before heading to the grocery store. This will help 
                    you avoid impulse purchases and save money in the long run.  
                  </p>
                  <p>Minimize restaurant spending: Eating out can be expensive, so try to limit 
                    the number of times you eat out each week. You can also save money by ordering 
                    water instead of soda or alcohol, sharing meals with friends, or using coupons. 
                  </p>
                  <p>Get discounts on entertainment: Look for discounts on entertainment options 
                    such as movies, concerts, and sporting events. You can also consider free activities 
                    such as hiking, visiting museums, or attending community events. 
                  </p>
                  <p>Track spending: Keep track of your expenses to identify areas where you can cut back. 
                    You can use apps like Mint or Personal Capital to track your spending automatically.
                  </p>
                  <p>Pay off high-interest debt: High-interest debt can be a significant drain on your finances. 
                    Consider paying off your high-interest debt first, such as credit card balances, before focusing on other savings goals. 
                  </p>
